# Backspace for Chrome

This Chrome extension brings back the famous backspace shortcuts to Chrome. 

Originally developed for Linux, where the backspace shortcuts where removed years ago, Google decided a while ago
to remove it from all Chrome builds, including Windows and OSX. Instead of making it an option for users to enable
or disable those shortcuts, they were completely removed. For different users on certain countries the alternative
shortcuts like `ALT+LEFT` / `ALT+RIGHT` are not a real alternative as two hands are required to execute it.

This extension brings back `BACKSPACE` to navigate back in the history and `SHIFT+BACKSPACE` to navigate forward.

## Installation

The extension is available in the Chrome store under: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/backspace-for-chrome/aeffggjddcchloadflonilaahpclmbnm
